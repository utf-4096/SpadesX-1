SpadesX is a C implementation for an Ace of Spades server that supports the protocol 0.75.

C was chosen because of its speed and the need for low latency in FPS games when modding the server as well as when scaling up.

## Why "SpadesX"?
We just one day decided to brainstorm the name and ended up on something that sounded cool yet still had the original naming.

## Installation

##### Libraries
Be sure to install the development versions of those:
* [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib)
* [json-c](https://github.com/json-c/json-c)
* [enet](https://github.com/lsalzman/enet)
* [libreadline](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/readline)
* [libbsd](https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/libbsd) (Only on some systems)

##### Unix based systems
Ubuntu 20.04 doesnt have the latest version of json-c and since SpadesX uses some functions that are in later releases you either have to build it on your own or update to 21.04+

> git clone https://github.com/SpadesX/SpadesX

> cd SpadesX

> mkdir build && cd build
 
> cmake ..
 
> make -jX (Replace X with number of threads you have on your system)

##### Windows
You can use mingw, but you'll still have to install the libraries first.
